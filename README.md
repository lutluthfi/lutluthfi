### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I really like mobile app development. I started by learning how to build an Android app in 2016. Until in 2019, I decided to change my course from Android to iOS. Starting a new challenge. This is my background as an iOS app developer.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Cartula Health](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/cartula-health/id1535421104?fbclid=IwAR0FnmQTTUGn94EPAMbA0vU3CdO8krTT7DfCWm9wfYDxhvvZpwEwgZqBGtQ) which is an e-health app as iOS developer
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning skill that needed to become lead iOS developer
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any interesting project that related to iOS app
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything that related to mobile app development or clean architecture
